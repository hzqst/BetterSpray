# BetterSpray

**BetterSpray** is a plugin for MetaHookSV that enhances Sven Co-op and GoldSrc‚Äôs spray system with support for high-res images, dynamic reloading and cloud sharing.

MetaHookSV: https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv

## üåü Main Features

### üñºÔ∏è Spray Management
- ‚úÖ Supports loading JPG/PNG/BMP/TGA/WEBP as spray texture, with alpha channel.
- ‚úÖ Auto-convert your image into .jpg in `/Sven Co-op/svencoop_downloads/custom_sprays/`, and upload to Steam profile. 
- ‚úÖ You may need to fill the screenshot description with "!Spray" and click the "Share" by yourself. In this case other guys with `BetterSprays.dll` installed will automatically download your sprays from Steam profile.
- ‚úÖ Auto-convert your image into `tempdecal.wad` in `/Sven Co-op/svencoop/` as a fallback for non-MetaHookSv users. (A game restart is required to refresh the cache of loaded `tempdecal.wad` if you has already been connected to a server)
