# F5 debugging (optional)

This page covers the optional Visual Studio `LaunchGame` startup project. Installing the plugin
and building it are in [Installation](installation.md) and
[Build instruction](build-instruction.md).

Install MetaHook and enable this plugin in the game's `plugins.lst` first. Configure a standalone Visual Studio Win32 solution:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build/launch -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32 -DMETAHOOKSV_ENABLE_LAUNCH_GAME=ON
```

Open the solution, select **LaunchGame** and press **F5**. **DeployGame** builds this plugin and its dependencies, stages Install, and copies plugin DLLs/PDBs/resources before the native debugger starts the existing game launcher. Root launchers/runtime files and plugin lists remain unchanged. Set VS to build before running and **Do not launch** on build errors; stop the game before redeploying. Ordinary builds do not deploy.

`METAHOOKSV_GAME_DIRECTORY` defaults to Steam discovery; `METAHOOKSV_GAME_APPID` defaults to `225840`. Set `METAHOOKSV_GAME_MOD` for a custom mod and `METAHOOKSV_GAME_ARGUMENTS` for extra arguments. Debug and Release are supported.

The shared module uses `METAHOOKSV_LAUNCH_GAME_MODULE_DIR`, the surrounding MetaHookSv checkout, or a pinned source archive. Without Installer sources, it downloads the self-contained CLI from GitHub `latest` (no .NET required); `METAHOOKSV_INSTALLER_RELEASE` selects a fixed tag, and `METAHOOKSV_INSTALLER_CLI_EXECUTABLE` supplies an offline EXE. Plugin mode requires v20261004c or later. Valid caches under `build/launch/launch-game/installer/<release>` are reused without update checks; select another tag or clear that private cache to upgrade. `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` may be supplied through the environment if GitHub API rate limits prevent the first download. The feature defaults OFF and performs no extra downloads when disabled.
